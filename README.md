# WebBLE

Initial partial implementation of the [Web Bluetooth](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/) 
spec for iOS, originally forked from [Paul Thierault](https://github.com/pauljt)'s [original implementation](https://github.com/pauljt/BleBrowser).

WebBLE is licensed under the Apache Version 2.0 License as per the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

### Distributions

-  [WebBLE](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/webble/id1193531073) was the first distribution and the one that I (daphtdazz) maintain and support. Purchasing this is the best way to support the project.

Others are available on the app store which provide varying levels of support / alternative features.

> If you would like to add your distribution to this list then please send a PR, but it should provide some extra functionality over WebBLE and not just be a direct clone.


## Supported APIs v1.7

### `navigator.bluetooth`

- `.getAvailability()` – added 1.7
- `.requestDevice(options)`
  - `options.acceptAllDevices = true` to ask for any device
  - `options.filters` is a list of filters (mutually exclusive with `acceptAllDevices`) with properties
    - `name`: devices with the given name will be included
    - `namePrefix`: devices with names with this prefix will be included
    - `services`: list of service aliases or uuids.

### `BluetoothDevice`

- `.id`
- `.name`
- `.gatt`
- `.gattserverdisconnected: EventHandler`

### `BluetoothRemoteGATTServer`

- `.connected`
- `.connect()`
- `.disconnect()`
- `.getPrimaryService(uuid)`
- `.getPrimaryServices()`

### `BluetoothRemoteGATTService`

- `.uuid`
- `.device`
- `.getCharacteristic(uuid)`
- `.getCharacteristics`

### `BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic`

- `.service`
- `.uuid`
- `.value`
- `.readValue()`
- `.writeValue(value)` (⚠️ but this is deprecated, prefer one of the below)
- `.writeValueWithResponse(value)` – added 1.7
- `.writeValueWithoutResponse(value)` – added 1.7
- `.oncharacteristicvaluechanged: EventHandler`
- `.startNotifications()`
- `.stopNotifications()`
- `.addEventListener()`
- `.removeEventListener()`

Everything else is TBD!

## Development

Info if you want to add features / fix bugs in the project.

### Setup

If you want to build and run locally, you just have to do the following:

- Set your `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` ID in Locations -> Custom Paths as per [this stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39669661/how-to-prevent-xcode-8-from-saving-development-team-in-pbxproj/40424891#40424891) answer, which is to avoid pushing personal / conflicting team IDs to github. 

### Testing

If you are maintaining your own release you can use those tests or write your own. If you want to spend the effort to start adding actual unit tests then that would be marvellous.

> 💡 If you have a device you'd like me to add tests for please get in contact with me!

#### End-to-end tests

The [end-to-end "device" tests](DeviceTests/) are run semi-manually before WebBLE versions are released to the App Store. Some of these require real devices to be used to test with properly.

To run these tests you should set up a local certificate for testing with and run

```bash
python3 https.py local-certificate-private-key.key local-certificate-public-cert.cer
```

See the docstring in https.py for instructions on settings up local certificates for testing (it's relatively straightforward...). You can also add an override in Info.plist to allow testing against a HTTP instead of an HTTPS server, but it's better just to create a local certificate.

#### Xcode unit tests

Currently there are no Xcode unit tests... partly because it's time-consuming and difficult to write meaningful unit tests since there are three things to test: the javascript APIs, the native glue layer and the actual behaviour of a bluetooth device at the other end. Instead the end-to-end tests are relied on for regression checking.
